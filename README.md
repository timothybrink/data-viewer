# Data Viewer

A simple graphing application, built in Electron, for viewing data over a serial port.

Very primative at this point. Features to add:

 - Automatically resizing chart
 - Data labels/units/etc
 - Multiple charts
 - Data export

So still a work in progress.

## Installation

Clone this repo, npm install, and run the build script.

It should build for the platform you are on. I haven't put a lot of work into this part yet though, and certainly haven't tested it on any platform but my own (Ubuntu 19.10). Try the electron-builder documentation (found [here](https://www.electron.build)) if you need more help.
