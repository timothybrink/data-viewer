# Data Viewer

A simple graphing application, built in Electron, for viewing data over a serial port.

Very primative at this point. Features to add:

 - Automatically resizing chart
 - Data labels/units/etc
 - Multiple charts
 - Data export

So still a work in progress.

## Installation

Clone this repo, npm install, and run the build script.
Make sure to run npm run rebuid after npm install to rebuild the serialport library for the version of NodeJS that Electron is using.
